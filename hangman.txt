A python programmed game which a user needs to guess the correct word. The user will get the number of chances which is
equal to the length of word.  The user will lose chance for each wrong guesses made and guesses will not be reduced for
the same wrong guesses made. If a word has two or more instances of the same letter, entering the letter single time would
be enough to fill all the instances of it. All the user play data and history will be stored in a database and the player
can see the player details and history at any time. In that case the user data stored in the database will be shown to the
user using a web page,
